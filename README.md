1. Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

The vehicle length and vehicle ground clearance provide non-random amounts of variance. The vehicle weight, spoiler angel, all wheel drive will likely provide a random amount of variance.

2. Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero. The p-value 5.35e-11 is less than 0.05%.

3. Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

The r-squared value is 0.7149. This means that 71% of every mpg prediction will be determined by this model. Due to the percentage it can be considered to predict mpg MechaCar prototypes effectively.
