## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

![Deliverable1.png](https://github.com/jaousley/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/Images/Deliverable1.png)

1. Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

- The vehicle length and vehicle ground clearance provide non-random amounts of variance. The vehicle weight, spoiler angel, all wheel drive will likely provide a random amount of variance.

2. Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

- 

3. Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
