## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

![Deliverable1.png](https://github.com/jaousley/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/Images/Deliverable1.png)

Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

  - The vehicle length and vehicle ground clearance provide non-random amounts of variance. The vehicle weight, spoiler angel, all wheel drive will likely provide a random amount of variance.

Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

  - The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero. The p-value 5.35e-11 is less than 0.05%.

Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

  - The r-squared value is 0.7149. This means that 71% of every mpg prediction will be determined by this model. Due to the percentage it can be considered to predict mpg MechaCar prototypes effectively. 


## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?

  - In the first image you can see the variance of the coils for all of the lots is 62.29 PSI, which does not exceed the requirements. When breaking down the data to view individual lots, Lot 1 has a PSI variance of 0.98. Lot 2 has a PSI variance of 7.47. Lot 3 has a PSI variance of 170.29 which exceeds the requirements.
